# Flashcards
When learning a new language, it can be hard to remember all the new vocabulary, which is exactly where ***flashcards*** can help. This program will 
impove your learning skills. With it help you can add cards, remove cards, import cards from files, export cards to files to repeat them later, ask the cards in random order, 
save your logs to file, show your hardest card(-s) to learn and reset all your incorrect answers!

## Usage

```bash
flashcards.py --import_from --export_to
Input the action (add, remove, import, export, ask, log, hardest card, reset stats, exit):
> add
The card:
> Austria
The definition of the card:
> Vienna
```
